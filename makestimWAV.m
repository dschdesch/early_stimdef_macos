function P2=makestimWAV(P);
% MakestimWAV - stimulus generator for WAV stimGUI
%    P=MakestimWAV(P), where P is returned by GUIval, generates the stimulus
%    specified in P. MakestimWAV is typically called by StimGuiAction when
%    the user pushes the Check, Play or PlayRec button.
%    MakestimWAV does the following:
%        * Complete check of the stimulus parameters and their mutual
%          consistency, while reporting any errors
%        * Compute the stimulus waveforms
%        * Computation and broadcasting info about # conditions, total
%          stimulus duration, Max SPL, etc.
%
%    MakestimWAV renders P ready for D/A conversion by adding the following 
%    fields to P
%            Fsam: sample rate [Hz] of all waveforms. This value is
%                  determined by carrier & modulation freqs, but also by
%                  the Experiment definition P.Experiment, which may 
%                  prescribe a minimum sample rate needed for ADC.
%            Fcar: carrier frequencies [Hz] of all the presentations in an
%                  Nx2 matrix or column array
%        Waveform: Waveform object array containing the samples in SeqPlay
%                  format.
%     Attenuation: scaling factors and analog attuater settings for D/A
%    Presentation: struct containing detailed info on stimulus order,
%                  broadcasting of D/A progress, etc.
